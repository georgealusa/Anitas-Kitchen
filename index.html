        <p>Protein comes in many forms, with plant-based options now widely available.
           Some people choose meat for the flavor, texture or nutrition profile, while others 
           are interested in alternatives.

            Is eating meat healthy? What is the best form of protein?
            
            Two dietitians helped answer our questions. Melissa Joy 
            Dobbins, MS, RDN, CDE, is the host of the Sound Bites podcast and Kim Kirchherr, MS, 
            RDN, LDN (IL), FAND, ACSM-CPT, President of K2 Outcomes LLC, specializes in the 
            connection of agriculture, food, nutrition and health.

        <p>Concerns about fat or cholesterol have caused some people to cut down on animal 
            protein. Good news for meat lovers is that healthy options continue to increase.
            Dobbins: “Beef is leaner today than ever before, making it easier for Americans
            to include lean beef in a variety of healthy diet patterns. More than 65 percent 
            of beef cuts available at the grocery store are considered ‘lean’ based on USDA 
            standards. In addition, 17 of the top 25 most popular beef cuts sold are ‘lean.’”            
            Kirchherr: “One of my favorite tips for efficient, informed shopping is to look 
            for the word ‘loin’ or ‘round’ in the name to choose a leaner cut of meat. Pork 
            tenderloin, for example, is an easy to cook, flavorful choice to make."</p>
