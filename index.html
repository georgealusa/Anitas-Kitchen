        <p>Fast food is the name given to food that can be cooked and served very quickly, 
           fast food can also be described as any food that provides little or no nutrient value to the diet but instead provides excess calories and fat, 
           fast food can be a great way to save time but it is not the proper way for nutrition as these foods are often of little nutritional benefit and 
           high in fat sugar and calories.

            protein. Good news for meat lovers is that healthy options continue to increase.
            Dobbins: “Beef is leaner today than ever before, making it easier for Americans
            to include lean beef in a variety of healthy diet patterns. More than 65 percent 
            of beef cuts available at the grocery store are considered ‘lean’ based on USDA 
            standards. In addition, 17 of the top 25 most popular beef cuts sold are ‘lean.’”            
            Kirchherr: “One of my favorite tips for efficient, informed shopping is to look 
            for the word ‘loin’ or ‘round’ in the name to choose a leaner cut of meat. Pork 
            tenderloin, for example, is an easy to cook, flavorful choice to make."</p>
